# Time-Series Forecasting

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of notebooks focused on time-series forecasting using various techniques, ranging from basic statistical methods to advanced deep learning models. These techniques are essential for predicting future values in a time-dependent dataset.

## Project Structure

- **Basic Forecasting Techniques**
  - `MachineLearning_Forecasting(Linear Regression & Dense Model).ipynb`: Implements basic forecasting using linear regression and dense neural networks.
  - `Moving_Average_Forcasting.ipynb`: Applies the moving average method to smooth and forecast time series data.
  - `Naive_forecasting.ipynb`: Demonstrates naive forecasting, a simple yet often effective method for time-series prediction.

- **Deep Learning Models**
  - `CNN_Forecasting.ipynb`: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for time-series forecasting by capturing local patterns in the data.
  - `LSTM-Forecasting.ipynb`: Implements Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are well-suited for capturing long-term dependencies in time-series data.
  - `RecurrentNeuralNetworks_Forecasting.ipynb`: Explores the use of traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for forecasting.
  - `Stateful_RNN_Forecasting.ipynb`: Applies stateful RNNs, which maintain the state across batches, to improve forecasting accuracy for time-series data with recurring patterns.

## Key Concepts

- **Basic Forecasting**: Techniques like linear regression, naive forecasting, and moving average are covered, providing a foundation for time-series analysis.
- **Deep Learning for Time-Series**: Advanced models like CNNs, LSTMs, and RNNs are employed to handle complex patterns and dependencies in time-series data.
- **Stateful vs. Stateless Models**: The difference between stateful and stateless RNNs is explored, with an emphasis on their application in time-series forecasting.

## Use Cases

These forecasting techniques can be applied to various domains, including:
- Financial market predictions
- Sales forecasting
- Weather prediction
- Inventory management
